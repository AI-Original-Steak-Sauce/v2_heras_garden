# Code Review Request - GLM Image Generation Work

## Work Summary
Completed autonomous generation of 21 P1 placeholder assets using GLM CogView-4 API via Z.AI.

## Key Changes
1. Created GLM image generation skill at `.claude/skills/glm-image-gen/`
2. Generated 21 P1 assets (crop icons, NPC sprites, potion icons, wheat assets, crafting/scene sprites)
3. Updated status report with all generated assets
4. Fixed security issue (removed hardcoded API key)
5. Added permissions configuration

## Current Issue
Attempting to generate remaining 3 P2 assets but receiving API error:
{"error":{"code":"401","message":"token expired or incorrect"}}

The API key being used in curl is the same as before (when generation worked).
Environment variable GLM_API_KEY shows as not set (%GLM_API_KEY% returns literal string).

## Files Changed
- 21 placeholder sprite files (PNG format, various sizes 32x32 to 256x144)
- game/textures/sprites/player.png (P0 asset)
- .claude/skills/glm-image-gen/ (new skill directory)
- docs/agent-instructions/setup-guides/cursor-permissions.md (new)
- .claude/settings.local.json (permissions added)

## Review Questions
1. Why is the API key now returning 401 when it worked before?
2. Is the curl command correctly accessing the environment variable on Windows?
3. Should the API key be stored differently for Windows batch/bash compatibility?
4. Are there any issues with the autonomous generation approach that need addressing?
