Circe's Garden Placeholder Asset Replacement List
Last updated: 2025-12-27

Notes
- Replace files in-place using the same filenames and formats.
- All PNGs should have transparent backgrounds unless noted (tiles and app icon can be opaque).
- Dimensions are from current placeholder files; keep the same size.
- Pixel art style: 32px tiles, 2x camera zoom (from CONTEXT.md).
- Proportions: avoid tall or stretched silhouettes. Favor compact bodies and slightly
  larger heads for readability. For 64x64 NPCs, target about 48h x 32w centered.
  For 32x32 icons, aim to fill about 24x24 with clean padding.

Art Style Guide (project-wide)
- Visual style: Pixel art, Stardew Valley readability, but Circe tone (mythic, moody, lush).
- Mood: Mediterranean, ancient Greek island, dusk-friendly palette, soft contrast.
- Colors: Natural earth and plant tones, muted jewel accents. Use the placeholder color hints
  as a baseline (see assets/sprites/PLACEHOLDER_README.md).
- Readability: Strong silhouettes, minimal noise, clear item shapes at 32x32.
- Lighting: Subtle highlights, no harsh specular. Soft ambient light feel.
- Theme: Magical but grounded (herbal, ritual, sea, moonlight, warm stone).
