## What This File Is

Short, stable pointer for the current phase and where to look next. Detailed step-by-step instructions live in `docs/execution/ROADMAP.md`.

## Current Focus (Phase 4)

1. Critical blockers (farm plot, doc alignment, input actions, TODO cleanup)
2. Minimal playable dialogue expansion
3. Placeholder audio and art
4. Recipe data completion
5. Basic balance + internal testing

---

## Status Tracking

- **RUNTIME_STATUS.md** is the per-action snapshot (local only, gitignored).
- **ROADMAP checkpoints** are the official 50% / 100% phase milestones.
- **GitHub Issues** track blockers and bugs.

---

## Next Steps

- Follow `docs/execution/PHASE_4_PROTOTYPE.md` in order.
- Update ROADMAP when Phase 4 hits 50% and 100%.
