Last updated: 2025-12-27

Notes
- Replace files in-place using the same filenames and formats.

Art Style Guide (project-wide)
- Visual style: Pixel art, Stardew Valley readability, but Circe tone (mythic, moody, lush).
- Mood: Mediterranean, ancient Greek island, dusk-friendly palette, soft contrast.
- Colors: Natural earth and plant tones, muted jewel accents. Use the placeholder color hints
  as a baseline (see assets/sprites/PLACEHOLDER_README.md).
- Readability: Strong silhouettes, minimal noise, clear item shapes at 32x32.
- Lighting: Subtle highlights, no harsh specular. Soft ambient light feel.
- Theme: Magical but grounded (herbal, ritual, sea, moonlight, warm stone).
