description: "Explain what you're doing in plain language for a non-technical audience"
---

You are providing a CEO-friendly technical explanation from .roo/commands/explain.md

## Required Structure:

**Plain-language summary**
- One short paragraph of what is happening.

**What I'm doing**
- 2-4 bullets describing actions in human terms.

**Why it matters**
- 1-3 bullets linking actions to user goals.

**Limits / risks**
- 1-3 bullets on uncertainty or what could go wrong.

**What I need from you (if anything)**
- If nothing is needed, say "Nothing right now."

## Rules:
1. Restate the request in simple terms
2. State your assumptions (what you think is happening)
3. Explain in plain language, using short sentences
4. Avoid jargon; if you must use a term, define it in one line
5. Close with a quick check: "Does this match what you wanted to know?"
